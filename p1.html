A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. 
Programming can be defined as the process of writing instructions and commands for a computer or other device, 
	to direct it and inform it about how to deal with data or how to carry out a series of required actions. 
The programming Programming are often defined as the process of writing instructions and commands for a computer or other device, 
to direct it and inform it about the way to affect data or the way to perform a series of required actions. 
The programming process follows rules specific to the language chosen by the programmer. Each language has its characteristics that distinguish it from the other and make it appropriate In varying degrees, for every sort of program and therefore the task required from this program.
 Also, programming languages even have common characteristics and customary borders, as long as of these languages are designed to affect the pc . 
Software languages develop with the event of computers (Hardware hardware). When the computer was invented within the forties and fifties of the last century (after the electrical calculation devices within the twenties) - 
The programming The programing language was also complicated, and it had been a series of numbers and written within the sort of long programming codes. These numbers are the zero numbers 0 and one 1, and this language is named binary or machine language, 
and this was difficult for programmers. But by creating a transistor that made the pc smaller in size and increased its capabilities, specialists and programmers at an equivalent time created innovative programming languages that were easier to use, and programming languages became widely understood by professionals.
 facilitation is stifacilitation remains ongoing.Characteristics of programing language s:The programming language is essentially a way that creates it easy for the programmer to write down his program within the sort of instructions and commands that the pc understands so as to hold out the specified work. 
it's known that the pc converts the programing language into a string of 0 and 1, and on the idea of which it begins its work. to write down commands, the chosen programing language provides a group of basic items to draw upon during the programâ€™s creation process and a group of rules that enable you to handle and organize information for the aim of performing the specified work. 
and rules are generand rules are generally: Information and storage Orders and organizing their conduct Special design Information and storage:Information is stored in current digital devices within the sort of numbers consistent with the binary counting system (i.e. hooked in to 0 and 1). generally , 
modern processors don't affect one bit but rather with groups of bits which will include: 8 bits = 1 byte, which is that the smallest information storage unit in modern computers. 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 bits. Using 8 bits, for instance , 256 different values are often formed, and this value are often between 0 and 255. The programing language function represents the exploitation of a unit or group of units (symbols) to store real-life information like names, 
measurements or checking account numbers.Orders and organizing their conduct:The programmer performs operations on information units like storing, reading and comparing them, and calculations also can be performed on them, and operations follow specific rules for the language. 
The programing language has another role, which is to regulate the organization of the conduct of operations, because it directs the implementation of its steps within the same sequence because it was written by the programmer. What the programmer wants to form is to divide two numbers that the user chooses, and to point out the result on the screen, and it's known that dividing by zero isn't permissible, and accordingly, 
the programmer must specify during this program this choice: if the denominator is contrary to zero, The program runs the pc , performs the operation, and provides the result. If the denominator is zero, the program doesn't perform the operation, but rather warns that the user tried to divide by zero. And orders are often organized in differently , where the implementation of an order or a gaggle of orders occurs repeatedly during a loop (Loop), 
and orders also can be divided into sub-units that every unit performs a selected work, and therefore the goal is to divide the work into parts that are easy to figure on separately in Ring loop body
